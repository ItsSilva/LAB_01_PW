# Lab 1 – Web Programming

In this lab, you must **select a website** of your choice and **recreate it using React components**.  
The chosen page can be:

- A dashboard  
- A landing page  
- An e-commerce site  
- A blog  
- Any other type of website  

The main goal is to **develop the visual structure** of the page and **organize the code into reusable components**.
